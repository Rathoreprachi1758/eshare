                        then-current price and term length for the next
                        subscription period. We will charge your credit card on
                        file with us on the first day of the renewal of the
                        subscription period. The Platform may suspend or
                        terminate the Services if Fees are past due. The
                        customer will provide complete and accurate billing and
                        contact information to Platform or the customer's
                        reseller.

                        Taxes. Fees are exclusive of taxes, and the customer is
                        responsible for all applicable taxes. The Company, or
                        the customer's reseller, will charge Taxes when
                        required. If the customer provides Company or its
                        reseller with a valid exemption certificate, the Company
                        will not collect the taxes covered by that certificate.
                        We may calculate the taxes you pay based on the billing
                        information you provide us at the time of purchase. You
                        are responsible for all charges related to using the
                        purchased Service (for example, data charges and
                        currency exchange settlements).

                        They are withholding Taxes. The customer will pay the
                        Company or its reseller net of any applicable
                        withholding taxes under applicable laws. If appropriate,
                        the customer and Company, or the customer's reseller,
                        will work together to avoid any withholding tax if
                        exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are
                        available. If the Company or customer's reseller
                        qualifies for a tax exemption or a reduced treaty
                        withholding rate, the Company or customer's reseller
                        will provide the customer with reasonable documentary
                        proof. The customer will provide Company or the
                        customer's reseller reasonable evidence that it has paid
                        the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.

                        Trials and Cancelation Policy. Customers can sign-up for
                        a trial for some of the Services, and your trial period
                        starts on the day you create the trial account and lasts
                        for seven days. If you are on a trial, you may cancel at
                        any time until the last day of your trial. If you do not
                        wish to incur charges, you must cancel the account by
                        the end of the 7th day. If you do not cancel your
                        account, then you authorize us to charge your credit
                        card for that specific Service. However, you may cancel
                        your subscription before the next billing cycle as per

                        authorized payment method information (e.g., credit card

                        payment method for the Services you have selected and
                        any paid feature(s) you choose. We may bill: (a) in
                        advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after
                        purchase; or (d) if you have elected a subscription

                        is yet to receive your payment, to bring your account up
                        to date, we may bill you simultaneously for both past
                        due and current amounts. If you do not cancel your
                        account, we may automatically renew your Service(s) and

                        failure to pay any charges or fees may result in the

                          purchase additional accounts or permanently delete the

                        take effect at the end of your then-current subscription
                        term (for example, if Customer is on a paid monthly
